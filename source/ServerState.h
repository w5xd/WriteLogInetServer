** November, 2001--original JAVA version
** November, 2009--C++ port using gSOAP
**
** Wayne E. Wright, W5XD
** Houston, Texas
**
**
** This is the main class for the Contest QSO server. Its public methods are all
** "synchronized" such that it must finish a request for any given client before
** starting on the next client.
**
** This class maintains a QSO logbook of QSO objects. Once it has been given a QSO,
** it NEVER lets it go (so its very important that clients do not send garbage,
** because the only way to remove it is to stop this web service and restart it.)
**
** The logbook is in the instance variable HashMap "id2QsoTable". Clients are
** required to assign a unique key to each QSO, and id2QsoTable maintains a
** map from those keys to the QSO values themselves. The key string must have
** a specific format. This format is not used in this server, but WriteLog
** uses the key to display the "network letter", and the "station id" for
** each QSO.
**
*********************
** Required format for a QSO key:
**		character number
**			0					Uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'
**			1 through 8			Hex digits, 0-9 or A-F. No other restrictions
**
**			9 through 12 		Hex digits, but may NOT all be 0 (zero)
**
**			13 through 18		Call sign of the originating station.
**                              Can be 6 or fewer characters, but must be at 
**								least one character. That is, the length of
**								the key string MUST be at least 14 characters.
**
**			If any client sends a key longer than 19 characters, this server
**			truncates the key.
**
*********************
**	Staying in sync	
**
** A client can poll for changes in the logbook since his last poll. He does
** this by using the LogState member of LogSummary and QsoUpdate. (Both mean
** the same thing--some web functions return one structure, some the other.)
**
** The LogState is a counter of all the QSO transactions that have happened
** to the server since it started. Adding a new QSO counts as one, and sending
** an update to an existing QSO also counts as one. A client keeps track of
** where he is in LogState space so that he can download only the QSOs he
** needs.
**
**
** Startup.
**
** The client first calls AddAndGetLogSummary to gather up all the.
** the IDs of all the QSOs in this logbook, It limits the return to 1000
** at a time.
**
** The client should download all the QSOs in the LogSummary using 
** getQsosByKeyArray. That function comes with a new LogState, but the 
** client can't use that LogState for much, because it reflects QSOs added
** to the log since the LogSummary.
**
** Next, the client should call AddAndGetLogSummary again, but this time
** sending QSOs it has, but did not appear in the original LogSummary. And
** The client should also set OldState to match the received LogState from
** the original LogSummary, and so can receive a list of IDs of QSOs that
** the client has not yet seen. The client should send no more than 100 QSOs
** in any one batch to the server. One reason is that the length of the messages
** to the server should not be extremely large--the server may simply reject
** the entire message. Another reason happens when the server restarts. It
** doesn't keep a disk copy of QSOs, but instead starts empty. There is no
** need for all the clients to resend all the QSOs to the server--each client
** should send blocks of 100, check the IDs it gets back, and remove those
** IDs from the list it plans to send to the server.
**
** Polling
**
** Once the client has gotten its LogState in sync with the server, it need
** only periodically call addAndGetQsos. The client will recognize a server
** restart by noticing he receives a null back instead of a QsoUpdate--the
** server does this when a client asks for a LogState that appears to be
** in the future. When a client gets this null, it must go all the way 
** back to the beginning--it must assume the server has restarted, and
** ask for a LogSummary using a -1 OldState and continue from there.
** 
**
*********************
**  EDITING QSOs already in the log.
**
** The client sends the edited QSO to the server using the same ID the QSO was
** originally assigned. However, the server uses two additional fields to decide
** what to do with this newly received QSO:
**
** If the Version on the new one is less than the Version on the one already in
** the log, the logbook ignores the new one.
**
** If the Version on the new one is greater than the one in the log, the logbook
** replaces the old QSO in the log with the new one.
**
** If the Version on the two match, then the UpdatedBy field of the two is examined.
** If they match, the logbook ignores the new. But if they are different, the 
** logbook replaces the old with the new, AND it increments the version number.
** The incremented version number eventually causes EVERYONE to have to redownload
** this edited QSO. The reason is that matching versions, but different UpdatedBy
** fields means that the QSO was edited simultaneously in two places at once. The
** logbook adopts the last one it sees, but has to have a way to tell everyone
** about the change.
**
** Client handling of QSO Versions and UpdatedBy
**
** A client gets to set the initial Version and Updated by field for all new QSOs.
** And it should always set them to zero, and an empty string, respectively. When
** a client changes a QSO it has already sent, it increments Version, and sets
** UpdatedBy to its own unique ID (WriteLog uses the call of the originating station.)
**
** When a client receives a QSO whose ID matches one it already has in its log,
** it should check the Version (but can ignore the UpdatedBy). If the Version
** matches, the client can ignore it. If its higher, the client must adopt the
** new QSO values as its own, replacing its entries with those received.
**
**
***********************
** Variable exchange fields
**
** This server handles the possible variation in exchange fields in a simple, but
** flexible way. Before sending any QSO values, a client must make a single call
** to: ColumnNamesToIndices
**
** The names it must send are the ADIF names (see the ADIF standard at 
** http://www.hosenose.com) for the columns it sends. The client sends an
** array of ADIF names, and the server responds with a a corresponding
** array of integers. These integers are the indices into the Qsoparts array
** of strings that goes with every QSO. Note that the returned array of
** integers may require the client to deal with "holes" in the Qsoparts
** array of each QSO. For example, If a client sends column names "RST_SENT"
** and "RST_RCVD" to ColumnNamesToIndices, it might get back, the array 
** {3, 0}, for example. That means the client must pack the RST_RCVD as
** the first string in qsoparts (the "0" in {3, 0}), and it must send
** an empty string at index 1 and index 2 of qsoparts, and it must pack
** the RST_SENT at index 3.
** When it receives a qsopart, the client must ignore any strings it
** receives at qsoparts[1], qsoparts[2], and any more entries beyond
** the one at qsoparts[3].
